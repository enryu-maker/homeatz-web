            answer:
                `
            Services Description: The Service is a technology platform that provides an online marketplace in which personal chefs, caterers and other individuals list, offer, sell and deliver food items and meal orders (“Meal(s)”) to the general public, and customers browse and purchase Meals. Users who purchase Meals through the Service are "Customer(s)," and users who list, prepare and sell Meals through the Service are "Chef(s)." A user may be both a Customer and Chef. All purchases are made directly (and any contract for purchase and sale is) between the Customer and Chef.

Homeatz offers a marketplace, it is not itself a Chef. The Service includes pricing assistance and delivery, but we are not a party to any purchase or sales transaction. We may also help facilitate the resolution of disputes between our Customers and Chefs, but Homeatz has no control over and does not guarantee (a) the existence, quality, safety, authenticity, or legality of Meals offered or sold on the Service; (b) the truth or accuracy of a Chef's content or listings on the Service; (c) the ability of a Chef to sell Meals through the Service and deliver Meals within required delivery windows; (d) the ability of Customers to pay for Meals purchased through the Service; or (e) that a Customer or Chef will actually complete a transaction, effectuate trouble-free delivery and shipping, or return a Meal through the Service.

Each Chef is solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and standards, including but not limited to those pertaining to the preparation, sale, marketing, and packaging of all Meals ordered through Homeatz, and updating details and prices relating to the Meals offered. Each Chef is solely liable for the quality, safety, and freshness of its products, and Homeatz does not verify the credentials, representations, products, services or prices offered by any Chefs, and does not guarantee the quality of the product or services, or that Chefs or Meals comply with applicable laws. Homeatz will not be liable or responsible for any Meals provided by Chefs that are a cause of injury or that do not meet your expectations in any manner.

Homeatz may enter into agreements with independent contractors (each a “Courier”) to provide delivery services. If a Chef chooses to use a Courier to deliver a Meal, Homeatz is not offering such delivery services and has no responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any Courier. Homeatz will not be liable or responsible for any delivery services provided by a Courier or any errors or misrepresentations made by them. Couriers are required to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Service is not available to minors (people under the age of majority) or to temporarily or permanently suspended users of the Service (both Customers and Chefs).

(Note: Homeatz does not support the accuracy of information or endorse any opinions contained on the Cook Alliance website)

b) Your Meals are prepared, cooked and served to Customers on the same day;
c) You sell Meals only to Customers who are consumers rather than wholesaler or retailers.

Ingredients and Allergens: For any particular Meal and related content posted using the Service, a Chef shall provide a comprehensive list of ingredients contained in or otherwise used to prepare the Meal, including any known allergens. Homeatz is not responsible for the accuracy of the information and labeling of Meals delivered to Customer. Customers should be advised that Meals may be prepared in facilities using the same equipment that is used to prepare Meals containing other allergens even if the allergen is marked as being absent from the food. Homeatz shall not be liable for any illness, health problem, or other damages that may result from any order or consumption of any Meals and related items purchased through the Service.

Chef Insurance: Homeatz does not maintain insurance for liabilities that may arise from your use of the Service as either a Customer or Chef. If you are a Chef, Homeatz recommends that you obtain appropriate insurance to cover the operation of your food facility and the preparation and delivery of Meals. Please review any respective insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Customers or any third party service.

Customer Review Guidelines: To the extent you are a Customer, Homeatz may allow you to upload content and leave reviews regarding your purchase of Meals. Homeatz may accept, reject or remove reviews and any associated content in its sole discretion. Homeatz has absolutely no obligation to screen or to delete reviews or associated content, even if anyone considers reviews objectionable or inaccurate. Those Customers posting reviews should comply with the following criteria: (1) reviewers should have firsthand experience with the person/entity being reviewed; (2) reviews should not contain: offensive language, profanity, or abusive, racist, or hate language; discriminatory references based on religion, race, gender, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation or disability; or references to illegal activity; (3) reviewers should not be affiliated with competitors if posting negative reviews; (4) reviewers should not make any conclusions as to the legality of conduct; and (5) reviewers may not post any false statements or organize a campaign encouraging others to post reviews, whether positive or negative. Reviews are not endorsed by Homeatz, and do not represent the views of Homeatz or of any affiliate or partner of Homeatz. Homeatz does not assume liability for any review or for any claims, liabilities or losses resulting from any review. Any review you post will be considered User Content (as defined below).

Marketplace Risk: Homeatz is not affiliated with or endorsed by any Chef, restaurant or other meal preparation service made available through the Service. Beyond its capacity as a marketplace and technology platform, Homeatz is not involved in any transaction between Customers and Chefs, and does not act as a Customer, Chef (or affiliate for a Customer or Chef) or broker with respect to any transactions. There are risks that you assume when dealing with other users (including those who may be acting under false pretenses) and all of these risks are borne by you, and not Homeatz. We encourage you to use the various functionalities of the Service (e.g., Chef profiles, meal options, and user reviews) to help evaluate the user with whom you are dealing.

Chefs as Independent Contractors: Users of the Service acting in the capacity of a Chef do so in their personal capacity as an independent contractor and not as an employee of Homeatz. As a Chef, you agree that: (i) you will accept any directions issued by Homeatz pertaining to the goals to be attained and the results to be achieved by Chefs generally, but you shall be solely responsible for the manner and hours in which your services are performed; (ii) you are responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws and registration requirements; (iii) these Terms of Service do not create an association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, or employer/employee relationship between you and Homeatz, or you and a Customer; (iv) you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent of Homeatz or any Customer; (v) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits that Homeatz may make available to its employees, such as vacation pay, sick leave, and insurance programs, including group health insurance or retirement benefits; and (vi) you are not eligible to recover contributor's compensation benefits in the event of injury. As a Chef, you will not engage a Customer in any way that may jeopardize your status as an independent contractor.

Homeatz does not control the behavior of users of the Service or the information or User Content (defined below) provided by other users. As a result, Homeatz does not guarantee or endorse the legality, authenticity, quality, or safety of any Meals offered or sold, the truth or accuracy of any listings, or the ability of Chefs to sell Meals or of Customers to buy Meals. We cannot assure that all transactions will be completed. Additionally, Homeatz does not guarantee the ability or intent of users to fulfill their obligations in any transactions. Homeatz reserves the right to delay the completion of any transaction for a reasonable period of time for purposes of fraud detection and otherwise protecting Homeatz and its users from illegal or wrongful activities or other violations of these Terms of Services.
Commercial Use: Unless otherwise expressly authorized herein or in the Service, you agree not to display, distribute, license, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, modify, sell, resell, exploit, transfer or upload for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service.

You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.
            
            If you dispute any charges you must let Homeatz know within fourteen (14) days after the date that Homeatz charges you.

Any change will be effective upon sharing of a revised Fee Policy to your registered email address with Homeatz. Your continued use of the Service after the fee change constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.
            
            Promotions: Homeatz may from time to time offer Customers certain promotions towards the purchase of Meals, and Customers may use such promotions in accordance with their terms. Depending on the type of promotion, it may reduce the amount of taxes that apply to a Customer's order. The application of the promotion will be reflected at the time of checkout and on the receipt of purchase.
            
            Packaging: Chefs agree to arrange their own packaging materials – ideally in the form of standard sized plastic boxes used by other popular food delivery platforms in Singapore. Chefs agree that it is their responsibility to pack and protect the food items for delivery and transit appropriately. They further understand that Homeatz and its delivery partner will not accept any liability for damages, breakage or any other temperature impacted damage on the delivery item due to any reasons, including  directly or indirectly caused by poor packing whatsoever, which contravenes these requirements. 
            
            Delivery: Chefs and customers agree that while Homeatz will endeavour to deliver the Delivery Items within the indicated timeframe, any delivery times stated or agreed or represented are estimates only. Delivery times may be affected by a number of factors, including those outside of Homeatz and its partner’s control such failure of equipment, bad weather and/or traffic conditions.

Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

a. Agreement to Arbitrate

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Homeatz, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Homeatz are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. 

b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND HOMEATZ AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND HOMEATZ AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

Homeatz is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction. We encourage you to initiate such conversations by reaching us via the ‘Contact Us’ section on the app. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Homeatz should be sent to 143 Cecil Street, #25-03, GB Building, Singapore 069542 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Homeatz and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Homeatz may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Homeatz or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Homeatz is entitled.

d. Arbitration Procedures

The arbitrator must follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator
award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Unless Homeatz and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

e. Confidentiality

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

f. Severability

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.

g. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement

Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Homeatz agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Homeatz written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).

Termination

You agree that Homeatz, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Homeatz believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Homeatz may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Homeatz may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Homeatz will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.

User Disputes

Homeatz reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.

General

These Terms of Service govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Homeatz with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws Singapore. The failure of Homeatz to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Homeatz, but Homeatz may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
